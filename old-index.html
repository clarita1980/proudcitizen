<h3>
Natural Valley Granola Shopper
</h3>
<h6>
June 2010 - Buenos Aires, Argentina - <i>Research commissioned by Nielsen</i>
</h6>
<hr />
<p>
The shopper technique is an ethnographic observation used to casually interview a shopper while they are selecting products in front of a specific shelf in a retail location.
</p>
<p>
For Natural Valley Granola we interviewed shoppers in supermarkets and kiosks in Buenos Aires. The goal of the research was to understand the behavior of cereal bar buyers in the process of shopping, the decision process involved and how the different elements influence the decision.
</p>
<p>
Goals: understand the Product Positioning and Advertising Campaigns / Promotions / Brand Loyalty
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Highlights:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Cereal bars are perceived as a substitute snack for cookies and chocolates between lunch and dinner with a bit more nutrition or less fat.
</li>
<li>
Consumers do not put cereal bars on their supermarket shopping list.
</li>
<li>
Although they are available in large supermarkets, consumers buy them in kiosks on the street.
</li>
<li>
There are more opportunities for point-of-purchase constructions to influence the purchase.
</li>
<li>
Cereal bars are consumed on-the-go and mostly with soda.
</li>
<li>
The secondary purchase driver is the texture of the bar: soft and humid vs. dry and hard.
</li>
<li>
With new ingredients like chocolate or yogurt the cereal bars are seen as the healthy version of candies.
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Nivea Sun Shopper</h3>
<h6>January 2010 - Buenos Aires, Argentina - <i>Research commissioned by Nielsen</i></h6>
<hr />
<p>
For Nivea Sun we interviewed shoppers in supermarkets and pharmacies in Buenos Aires. The goal of the research was to understand the behavior of sunscreen buyers in front of the shelf and the drivers involved in the process of buying a product.
</p>
<hr />

<h4>Highlights:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
In the minds of consumers we studied the concept of the sun generates ambivalent ideas:
<br />
1. I want to be tanned but not as much as to be seen like a dry raisin.
<br />
2. I need to take care of my skin but I also need to look good.
<br />
</li>
<li>
There is a tension between the rational side of the brain, which suggests care and protection against UV rays, and the emotional side, which seeks corporal beauty and joy via links to a tanned body.
</li>
<li>
Consumers feel disoriented at the moment of purchasing one product because of over-specific product variants. Product offering variants are based on skin type, skin color and solar protective factor. For example: Deramglos sunscreen factor 60 is also advertised for people with extra sensitive skin but this confused some women that do not perceive their skin as sensitive but are willing to protect it from the sun.
</li>
<li>
Purchasing a sunscreen is a concern that arises just before the vacations. Few people will use it to walk or exercise outdoors during the rest of the year.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>La Salte&ntilde;a</h3>
<h6>August 2010 - Buenos Aires, Argentina - <i>Research commissioned by Nielsen</i></h6>

<hr />
<p>
For La Salte&ntilde;a we interviewed shoppers in supermarkets and mini-markets in Buenos Aires. The goal of the research was to understand the behavior of pie dough and pasta buyers in front of the shelf at time of purchase.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>
Highlights:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Shoppers compared pastas to foods such as hamburgers and hot dogs.
</li>
<li>
Ingredients like meat and chicken do not have a good reputation inside the pastas since it is associated to processed meat.
</li>
<li>
Shoppers identified a gap in the market offering referring to wheat dough and pastas made with seeds.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>CAPIA - In-home Observation</h3>
<h6>March 2009 - Buenos Aires, Argentina - <i>Research commissioned by Nielsen</i></h6>

<hr />


<p>
Observation and in-depth interviews with women in their Buenos Aires homes while cooking with eggs. The goal of the research was to discover how consumers use and represent eggs in their diet.
</p>

<hr />
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Brand is not a key element in the egg purchase decision process.
</li>
<li>
Eggs have protein similar to meat but consumers don't think or care about the different types of eggs providing different amounts of protein as they do when buying meat.
</li>
<li>
The interviewed women did not signify eggs as a priority in their diets despite the fact that eggs are used as a cooking ingredient in a majority of their meals.
</li>
<li>
Farm eggs create an ambivalent sensation: they are more natural and fresh but the presence of a feather or other imperfection produces disgust.
</li>
<li>
Consumers are not sure if eggs contain cholesterol or not.
</li>
<li>
There is not a clear value proposition around the egg.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Zorro - In-home Observation</h3>

<h6>October 2008 - Buenos Aires, Argentina - <i>Research commissioned by Ipsos</i></h6>
<hr />

<p>
Observation and in-depth interview of women in their homes while using a cloth washing product.
</p>
<p>
The primary goal of the research was to gain insights into the laundry process from users and non-users of the brand. Secondary goals included the identification of locations where the laundry process begins and ends and gaining an understanding of the emotional aspects behind clean and dirty clothes.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Clean clothing speaks about your identity and competency as a wife, as a mother and someone responsible for your family's well-being.
</li>
<li>
The need for clothing to be washed goes beyond seeing the clothing as dirty. The passing of the time requires washing it. The clothing that has one stain is not necessarily seen as dirty however it requires washing. This means that usually much more clothing is being washed than what advertising promotes for its products.

</ul>

<h3>CLOROX - In-home Observation</h3>
<h6>June 2010 - Santiago, Chile - <i>Research commissioned by Nielsen</i></h6>
<hr />
<p>
Observation and in-depth interview of women in their homes while using a clothing cleaning product as well as accompanied shopping in mini-markets and supermarkets.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the research was to gain further understanding of the consumers in their role while shopping for products in the Laundry Additives Category. Our team studied the shopping experience from planning to execution to gain insights.
</p>
<hr />
<h4>
Highlights:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
The location of Clorox in many supermarkets close to the chlorine product for cleaning floors created a fear for many shoppers connected to the long-term results of using bleach to clean clothing.
</li>
<li>
The brand can focus on the emotional attributes condensed behind a clean cloth: dedication, love, responsibility and care for yourself and your family. 
</li>
<li>
The buyers that linked Clorox to the chlorine used to clean the floors are more likely to buy a powder variety.
</li>
</ul>
